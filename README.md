# StartUpData_Multiple_Linear_Regression
To prepare a prediction model for "profit" of 50_startups Data and performing transformations to the features for getting better predictions of profit and calculating the  R^2 value for each prepared prediction  model.



Data Features-

R&D Spend -- Research and devolop spend in the past few years
Administration -- spend on administration in the past few years
Marketing Spend -- spend on Marketing in the past few years
State -- states from which data is collected
Profit  -- profit of each state in the past few years


Here Feature "Profit" is the dependent variable and rest all the features are independent in nature and we will bring out a multiple linear regression equation in between the output variable(Label) with the input variables(i/p features) and look through the relationship between the input and the output.
